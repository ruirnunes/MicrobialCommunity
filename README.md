# Requirements
To use both scripts, "simulation_script.ipynb" and "Community.ipynb" you first need to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), and then create a conda environment with the "community_env.yml" file. Lastly, to run the "simulation_script.ipynb" file it is required the [ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio](https://www.ibm.com/academic/topic/data-science) solver.


## Note
"simulation_script.ipynb" allows for single model simulation while "Community.ipynb" enables community modeling.
